# GazeOfBalor
## Overview 
Gaze of Balor is an immersive 2.5D role-playing adventure combining a classic RPG interface to perform intense LARP inspired combat 
sequences.Players must combat both their “Geass” and repel the endless attacks of ancient enemies before delving deep into the Fomorian 
Fortress to slay Balor.
## Mechanics
### Combat
This is the main focus of the demo. The aim of the combat system is to make the player feel epic via the use of "infinite" combos. This 
means that the player can continually strike as a person would rather than following a set number of hits to complete a pattern. This is
done by having a set number of types of hits for each combat style from each direction and allowing the player to impliment each type of 
hit. This is limmited by a stamina bar so the player will tire as though they would in real life.
